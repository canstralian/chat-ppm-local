# Chat Interface with GPT-3

This project provides a simple chat interface that communicates with the GPT-3 model from OpenAI. It allows users to input messages, which are then sent to the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI API. The model generates responses to the messages, which are displayed back to the user in the chat interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Flask
- Requests library
- OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install Flask and the requests library using pip:

6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the chat interface.

7. Start typing messages in the input field and press "Send". The model will generate responses, which will be displayed in the chat interface.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive chat interface.
- Messages are displayed with timestamps.
- Automatic scrolling to the latest message.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the chat interface by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in `index.html`.

## Notes

- Ensure that you comply with OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines when using the GPT-3 model.
- This project is intended for educational purposes and may require additional modifications for production use.
